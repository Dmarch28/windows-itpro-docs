# Configure Autopilot profiles

**Applies to**

-   Windows 10

For each device that has been defined to the Windows Autopilot deployment service, a profile of settings needs to be applied that specifies the exact behavior of that device when it is deployed. For detailed procedures on how to configure profile settings and register devices, see [Registering devices](add-devices.md#registering-devices).

## Profile download

When an Internet-connected Windows 10 device boots up, it will attempt to connect to the Autopilot service and download an Autopilot profile. Note: It is important that a profile exists at this stage so that a blank profile is not cached locally on the PC. To remove the currently cached local profile in Windows 10 version 1803 and earlier, it is necessary to re-generalize the OS using **sysprep /generalize /oobe**, reinstall the OS, or re-image the PC. In Windows 10 version 1809 and later, you can retrieve a new profile by rebooting the PC.

When a profile is downloaded depends on the version of Windows 10 that is running on the PC. See the following table.

| Windows 10 version | Profile download behavior |
| --- | --- |
| 1703 and 1709 | The profile is downloaded after the OOBE network connection page. This page is not displayed when using a wired connection. In this case, the profile is downloaded just prior to the EULA screen. |
| 1803 | The profile is downloaded as soon as possible.  If wired, it is downloaded at the start of OOBE. If wireless, it is downloaded after the network connection page. |
| 1809 | The profile is downloaded as soon as possible (same as 1803), and again after each reboot. |

If you need to reboot a computer during OOBE: 
- Press Shift-F10 to open a command prompt.
- Enter **shutdown /r /t 0** to restart immediately, or **shutdown /s /t 0** to shutdown immediately.

For more information, see [Windows Setup Command-Line Options](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-setup-command-line-options).

## Profile settings

The following profile settings are available:

-   **Skip Cortana, OneDrive and OEM registration setup pages**. All devices registered with Autopilot will automatically skip these pages during the out-of-box experience (OOBE) process.

-   **Automatically setup for work or school**. All devices registered with Autopilot will automatically be considered work or school devices, so this question will not be asked during the OOBE process.

-   **Sign in experience with company branding**. Instead of presenting a generic Azure Active Directory sign-in page, all devices registered with Autopilot will automatically present a customized sign-in page with the organization’s name, logon, and additional help text, as configured in Azure Active Directory. See [Add company branding to your directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/customize-branding#add-company-branding-to-your-directory) to customize these settings.

-   **Skip privacy settings**. This optional Autopilot profile setting enables organizations to not ask about privacy settings during the OOBE process. This is typically desirable so that the organization can configure these settings via Intune or other management tool.

-   **Disable local admin account creation on the device**. Organizations can decide whether the user setting up the device should have administrator access once the process is complete.

-   **Skip End User License Agreement (EULA)**. Starting in Windows 10 version 1709, organizations can decide to skip the EULA page presented during the OOBE process. This means that organizations accept the EULA terms on behalf of their users.

-   **Disable Windows consumer features**. Starting in Windows 10 version 1803, organizations can disable Windows consumer features so that the device does not automatically install any additional Microsoft Store apps when the user first signs into the device. See the [MDM documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-experience#experience-allowwindowsconsumerfeatures) for more details.
