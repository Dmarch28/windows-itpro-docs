When Windows Setup fails, the result and extend code are recorded as an informational event in the Application log by Windows Error Reporting as event 1001. The event name is **WinSetupDiag02**.  You can use Event Viewer to review this event, or you can use Windows PowerShell.

To use Windows PowerShell, type the following commands from an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt:

```
$events = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName="Application";ID="1001";Data="WinSetupDiag02"}
$event = [xml]$events[0].ToXml()
$event.Event.EventData.Data
```

To use Event Viewer: 
1. Open Event Viewer and navigate to **Windows Logs\Application**.
2. Click **Find**, and then search for **winsetupdiag02**.
3. Double-click the event that is highlighted.

Note: For legacy operating systems, the Event Name was WinSetupDiag01. 

Ten parameters are listed in the event:
<br>
<table border="0">
<tr><td>P1: The Setup Scenario (1=Media,5=WindowsUpdate,7=Media Creation Tool)</td></tr>
<tr><td>P2: Setup Mode (x=default,1=Downlevel,5=Rollback)</td></tr>
<tr><td>P3: New OS Architecture (x=default,0=X86,9=AMD64)</td></tr>
<tr><td>P4: Install Result (x=default,0=Success,1=Failure,2=Cancel,3=Blocked)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>P5: Result Error Code</b>  (Ex: 0xc1900101)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>P6: Extend Error Code</b>  (Ex: 0x20017)</td></tr>
<tr><td>P7: Source OS build (Ex: 9600)</td></tr>
<tr><td>P8: Source OS branch (not typically available)</td></tr>
<tr><td>P9: New OS build (Ex: 16299}</td></tr>
<tr><td>P10: New OS branch (Ex: rs3_release}</td></tr>
</table>

The event will also contain links to log files that can be used to perform a detailed diagnosis of the error.  An example of this event from a successful upgrade is shown below.
