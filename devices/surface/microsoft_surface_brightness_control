# Introduction

When deploying Surface devices in point of sale or other “always-on”
kiosk scenarios, you can optimize power management using the new Surface
Brightness Control (SBC) app.

Available for download with [Surface Tools for
IT](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46703), SBC is
designed to help reduce thermal load and lower the overall carbon
footprint. The tool automatically dims the screen when not in use and
includes the following configuration options:

  - Period of inactivity before dimming the display.

  - Brightness level when dimmed.

  - Maximum brightness level when in use.

**To run SBC:**

  - Install surfacebrightnesscontrol.msi on the target device and SBC
    will begin working immediately.

# Configuring SBC
